  I am an avid coder. I love to create websites, command line interfaces, and other awesome 
  sh*t. I'm not always a couch potato, here are some of my projects I created. 
`;

export const PROJECT_1 = `
  I go to mandarin language school on Sundays. I noticed that their COVID check-in system is super slow.
  So I created a website that helps our school check-in faster with custom QR codes. 
`;

export const PROJECT_2 = `
  The website you are viewing right now is one of my projects! My personal website is created with 
  React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
`;

export const PROJECT_3 = `
  I created a CRUD website sort of like linktr.ee, where you can introduce yourself with a link. Disclaimer: 
  The Project is not in production yet. 
`;

export const PROJECT_4 = `
  I created a project to look at quotes. You can like and save quotes and search for them as well. Want to get freaky? Press 'Random '
  to get a random quote. 
`;

export const PROJECT_5 = `
  I believe in freedom and security of the internet. I created a website to share images with a link. The catch is that the image is 
  deleted after a viewer has seen the image. Make your image transfers quick and private. (Secure file uploading app in development!)
`;

export const PROJECT_6 = `
  I built a chat app that uses chat rooms with a chat filter for students. Sign up with Google and join a chat room with a code.
`;

export const PROJECT_7 = `
  I created this app in less than fifteen minutes. This was one of my first apps on how I learned to connect and API to a React website. Search definitions for words.
